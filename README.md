# ✈️ Airline Reservation System

A **Java-based airline reservation system** designed to simulate a real-world flight booking application.  
This desktop application allows users to **search flights, reserve seats, manage bookings, and generate tickets** using an intuitive GUI (typically using Java Swing) and a backend database.

## 📌 About the Project

This project replicates the core features of an airline booking system — like those used by airlines and travel portals — to handle transactions such as **searching flights, reserving seats, and printing tickets**.  
It showcases **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, event-driven UI, and database integration (if implemented). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
